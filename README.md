# LeptonicaSharp Alpha

- Full featured wrapper for leptonica 1.76.0
- This is a alpha Version - Bugs are inclusive

# Functions:

- VB.Net 4.0 Library
- supports all Leptonica-Functions
- included all propertys from Leptonica structs via Marshaler
- complete documentation and debug-informations from C-Files included

# Todo:

- Functions are only checks if parameter is not nothing, but not the format, e.g. 8 Bit depth.
- move array marshalers to the back of the parameter-copy.
- define marshal arrays with the right size (hopefully always 'nalloc')
- Updates for Property values.
- implement void return types as objects
- check byVal and byRef Values.

# Info:
- Optional parameters moved to the back of the parameters, this differs from C-Source definition
  and maybe the comments.

# How to Implement

1. Copy the files from the Dll-folder into your project and add
   a link to LeptonicaSharp. (X32)

# How to extend predefined classes:

1. You can simple extend the classes via
Partial Class Pix
  Function DoAnything (Parameters) as Pix
    ' Natives always return a Pointer,
    ' Classes always created by a Pointer
    return new Pix (Natives.AnyFunction(Parameters))
  End Function
 End Class
 2. Compile again.

# How to compile the C-DLL

1. Download the latest version of CMake from https://cmake.org/ and install
2. Download the latest version of cppan from https://cppan.org/ and copy to CMake\Bin folder
3. Open Cmd and switch to Leptonica C-Source folder. (Or shift-right click and select "CommandPrompt here")
4. Type: "Set Path="Path to CMake-Bin"
5. Type: "cppan --build pvt.cppan.demo.danbloomberg.leptonica"

# Example

- Imports LeptonicaSharp
- Dim Pix as Pix = New LeptonicaSharp.Pix("Test.jpg")
- PictureBox1.Backgroundimage = Pix.toBitmap
- Pix.SaveAutoFormat ("Test.jp2", JP2)

# Special thanks
- Leptonica for this great c-library
- Leptonica.Net for inspiration and implementation comparison
- Clang for the great tool 
- NClang for the wrapper around clang
