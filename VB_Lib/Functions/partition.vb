'''  <summary>
''' <para/>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' (1) This uses the elegant Breuel algorithm, found in "Two<para/>
''' Geometric Algorithms for Layout Analysis", 2002,<para/>
''' url: "citeseer.ist.psu.edu/breuel02two.html".<para/>
''' It starts with the bounding boxes (b.b.) of the connected<para/>
''' components (c.c.) in a region, along with the rectangle<para/>
''' representing that region.  It repeatedly divides the<para/>
''' rectangle into four maximal rectangles that exclude a<para/>
''' pivot rectangle, sorting them in a priority queue<para/>
''' according to one of the six sort flags.  It returns a boxa<para/>
''' of the "largest" set that have no intersection with boxes<para/>
''' from the input boxas.<para/>
''' (2) If box == NULL, the initial region is the minimal region<para/>
''' that includes the origin and every box in boxas.<para/>
''' (3) maxboxes is the maximum number of whitespace boxes that will<para/>
''' be returned.  The actual number will depend on the image<para/>
''' and the values chosen for maxoverlap and maxpops.  In many<para/>
''' cases, the actual number will be 'maxboxes'.<para/>
''' (4) maxoverlap allows pruning of whitespace boxes depending on<para/>
''' the overlap.  To avoid all pruning, use maxoverlap = 1.0.<para/>
''' To select only boxes that have no overlap with each other<para/>
''' (maximal pruning), choose maxoverlap = 0.0.<para/>
''' Otherwise, no box can have more than the 'maxoverlap' fraction<para/>
''' of its area overlapped by any larger (in the sense of the<para/>
''' sortflag) box.<para/>
''' (5) Choose maxperim (actually, maximum half-perimeter) to<para/>
''' represent a c.c. that is small enough so that you don't care<para/>
''' about the white space that could be inside of it.  For all such<para/>
''' c.c., the pivot for 'quadfurcation' of a rectangle is selected<para/>
''' as having a reasonable proximity to the rectangle centroid.<para/>
''' (6) Use fract in the range [0.0 ... 1.0].  Set fract = 0.0<para/>
''' to choose the small box nearest the centroid as the pivot.<para/>
''' If you choose fract  is greater  0.0, it is suggested that you call<para/>
''' boxaPermuteRandom() first, to permute the boxes (see usage below).<para/>
''' This should reduce the search time for each of the pivot boxes.<para/>
''' (7) Choose maxpops to be the maximum number of rectangles that<para/>
''' are popped from the heap.  This is an indirect way to limit the<para/>
''' execution time.  Use 0 for default (a fairly large number).<para/>
''' At any time, you can expect the heap to contain about<para/>
''' 2.5 times as many boxes as have been popped off.<para/>
''' (8) The output result is a sorted set of overlapping<para/>
''' boxes, constrained by 'maxboxes', 'maxoverlap' and 'maxpops'.<para/>
''' (9) The main defect of the method is that it abstracts out the<para/>
''' actual components, retaining only the b.b. for analysis.<para/>
''' Consider a component with a large b.b.  If this is chosen<para/>
''' as a pivot, all white space inside is immediately taken<para/>
''' out of consideration.  Furthermore, even if it is never chosen<para/>
''' as a pivot, as the partitioning continues, at no time will<para/>
''' any of the whitespace inside this component be part of a<para/>
''' rectangle with zero overlapping boxes.  Thus, the interiors<para/>
''' of all boxes are necessarily excluded from the union of<para/>
''' the returned whitespace boxes.<para/>
''' (10) It should be noted that the algorithm puts a large number<para/>
''' of partels on the queue.  Setting a limit of X partels to<para/>
''' remove from the queue, one typically finds that there will be<para/>
''' several times that number (say, 2X - 3X) left on the queue.<para/>
''' For an efficient algorithm to find the largest white or<para/>
''' or black rectangles, without permitting them to overlap,<para/>
''' see pixFindLargeRectangles().<para/>
''' (11) USAGE: One way to accommodate to this weakness is to remove such<para/>
''' large b.b. before starting the computation.  For example,<para/>
''' if 'box' is an input image region containing 'boxa' b.b. of c.c.:<para/>
''' // Faster pivot choosing<para/>
''' boxaPermuteRandom(boxa, boxa)<para/>
''' // Remove anything either large width or height<para/>
''' boxat = boxaSelectBySize(boxa, maxwidth, maxheight,<para/>
''' L_SELECT_IF_BOTH, L_SELECT_IF_LT,<para/>
''' NULL)<para/>
''' boxad = boxaGetWhiteblocks(boxat, box, type, maxboxes,<para/>
''' maxoverlap, maxperim, fract,<para/>
''' maxpops)<para/>
''' The result will be rectangular regions of "white space" that<para/>
''' extend into (and often through) the excluded components.<para/>
''' (11) As a simple example, suppose you wish to find the columns on a page.<para/>
''' First exclude large c.c. that may block the columns, and then call:<para/>
''' boxad = boxaGetWhiteblocks(boxa, box, L_SORT_BY_HEIGHT,<para/>
''' 20, 0.15, 200, 0.2, 2000)<para/>
''' to get the 20 tallest boxes with no more than 0.15 overlap<para/>
''' between a box and any of the taller ones, and avoiding the<para/>
''' use of any c.c. with a b.b. half perimeter greater than 200<para/>
''' as a pivot.<para/>
