''' (1) This computes the size of the block of memory required<para/>
''' and allocates it.  Each chunk starts on a 32-bit word boundary.<para/>
''' The chunk sizes are in powers of 2, starting at %smallest,<para/>
''' and the number of levels and chunks at each level is<para/>
''' specified by %numalloc.<para/>
''' (2) This is intended to manage the image data for a small number<para/>
''' of relatively large pix.  The system malloc is expected to<para/>
''' handle very large numbers of small chunks efficiently.<para/>
''' (3) Important: set the allocators and call this function<para/>
''' before any pix have been allocated.  Destroy all the pix<para/>
''' in the normal way before calling pmsDestroy().<para/>
''' (4) The pms struct is stored in a static global, so this function<para/>
''' is not thread-safe.  When used, there must be only one thread<para/>
