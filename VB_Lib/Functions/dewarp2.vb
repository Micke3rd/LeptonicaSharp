'''  <summary>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' 
''' (1) This is the basic function that builds the horizontal and
''' vertical disparity arrays, which allow determination of the
''' src pixel in the input image corresponding to each
''' dest pixel in the dewarped image.<para/>
''' 
''' (2) Sets vsuccess = 1 if the vertical disparity array builds.
''' Always attempts to build the horizontal disparity array,
''' even if it will not be requested (useboth == 0).
''' Sets hsuccess = 1 if horizontal disparity builds.<para/>
''' 
''' (3) The method is as follows:
''' (a) Estimate the points along the centers of all the
''' long textlines.  If there are too few lines, no
''' disparity models are built.
''' (b) From the vertical deviation of the lines, estimate
''' the vertical disparity.
''' (c) From the ends of the lines, estimate the horizontal
''' disparity, assuming that the text is made of lines
''' that are close to left and right justified.
''' (d) One can also compute an additional contribution to the
''' horizontal disparity, inferred from slopes of the top
''' and bottom lines.  We do not do this.<para/>
''' 
''' (4) In more detail for the vertical disparity:
''' (a) Fit a LS quadratic to center locations along each line.
''' This smooths the curves.
''' (b) Sample each curve at a regular interval, find the y-value
''' of the mid-point on each curve, and subtract the sampled
''' curve value from this value.  This is the vertical
''' disparity at sampled points along each curve.
''' (c) Fit a LS quadratic to each set of vertically aligned
''' disparity samples.  This smooths the disparity values
''' in the vertical direction.  Then resample at the same
''' regular interval.  We now have a regular grid of smoothed
''' vertical disparity valuels.<para/>
''' 
''' (5) Once the sampled vertical disparity array is found, it can be
''' interpolated to get a full resolution vertical disparity map.
''' This can be applied directly to the src image pixels
''' to dewarp the image in the vertical direction, making
''' all textlines horizontal.  Likewise, the horizontal
''' disparity array is used to left- and right-align the
''' longest textlines.

''' 
''' (1) This starts with points along the centers of textlines.
''' It does quadratic fitting (and smoothing), first along the

''' the vertical line warping.<para/>
''' 
''' (2) Use %rotflag == 1 if you are dewarping vertical lines, as
''' is done in dewarpBuildLineModel().  The usual case is for
''' %rotflag == 0.<para/>
''' 
''' (3) Note that this builds a vertical disparity model (VDM), but
''' does not check it against constraints for validity.

''' 
''' (3) This takes a 1 bpp %pixb where both vertical and horizontal
''' disparity have been applied, so the text lines are straight and,

''' It estimates the foreshortening of the characters on the
''' binding side, and if significant, computes a one-dimensional

''' (4) The first attempt was to use the average width of the

''' (5) We use the density of vertical strokes, measured by first using
''' a vertical opening, which improves the signal.  The result
''' is relatively insensitive to the size of the opening we use
''' a 10-pixel opening.  The relative density is measured by
''' finding the number of c.c. in a full height sliding window
''' of width 50 pixels, and compute every 25 pixels.  Similar results
