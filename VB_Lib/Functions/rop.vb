'''  <summary>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' 
''' (1) This has the standard set of 9 args for rasterop.
''' This function is your friend it is worth memorizing!<para/>
''' 
''' (2) If the operation involves only dest, this calls
''' rasteropUniLow().  Otherwise, checks depth of the
''' src and dest, and if they match, calls rasteropLow().<para/>
''' 
''' (3) For the two-image operation, where both pixs and pixd
''' are defined, they are typically different images.  However
''' there are cases, such as pixSetMirroredBorder(), where
''' in-place operations can be done, blitting pixels from
''' one part of pixd to another.  Consequently, we permit
''' such operations.  If you use them, be sure that there
''' is no overlap between the source and destination rectangles
''' in pixd (!)
''' Background:
''' -----------
''' There are 18 operations, described by the op codes in pix.h.
''' One, PIX_DST, is a no-op.
''' Three, PIX_CLR, PIX_SET, and PIX_NOT(PIX_DST) operate only on the dest.
''' These are handled by the low-level rasteropUniLow().
''' The other 14 involve the both the src and the dest, and depend on
''' the bit values of either just the src or the bit values of both
''' src and dest.  They are handled by rasteropLow():
''' PIX_SRC     s
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC)   ~s
''' PIX_SRC | PIX_DST   s | d
''' PIX_SRC [and] PIX_DST   s [and] d
''' PIX_SRC ^ PIX_DST   s ^ d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) | PIX_DST ~s | d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) [and] PIX_DST ~s [and] d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) ^ PIX_DST ~s ^ d
''' PIX_SRC | PIX_NOT(PIX_DST)  s | ~d
''' PIX_SRC [and] PIX_NOT(PIX_DST)  s [and] ~d
''' PIX_SRC ^ PIX_NOT(PIX_DST)  s ^ ~d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC | PIX_DST) ~(s | d)
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC [and] PIX_DST) ~(s [and] d)
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC ^ PIX_DST) ~(s ^ d)
''' Each of these is implemented with one of three low-level
''' functions, depending on the alignment of the left edge
''' of the src and dest rectangles:
''' a fastest implementation if both left edges are
''' (32-bit) word aligned
''' a very slightly slower implementation if both left
''' edges have the same relative (32-bit) word alignment
''' the general routine that is invoked when
''' both left edges have different word alignment
''' Of the 14 binary rasterops above, only 12 are unique
''' logical combinations (out of a possible 16) of src
''' and dst bits:
''' (sd) (11) (10) (01) (00)
''' -----------------------------------------------
''' s  1  1  0  0
''' ~s  0  1  0  1
''' s | d  1  1  1  0
''' s [and] d  1  0  0  0
''' s ^ d  0  1  1  0
''' ~s | d  1  0  1  1
''' ~s [and] d  0  0  1  0
''' ~s ^ d  1  0  0  1
''' s | ~d 1  1  0  1
''' s [and] ~d 0  1  0  0
''' s ^ ~d 1  0  0  1
''' ~(s | d)  0  0  0  1
''' ~(s [and] d)  0  1  1  1
''' ~(s ^ d)  1  0  0  1
''' Note that the following three operations are equivalent:
''' ~(s ^ d)
''' ~s ^ d
''' s ^ ~d
''' and in the implementation, we call them out with the first form
''' namely, ~(s ^ d).
''' Of the 16 possible binary combinations of src and dest bits,
''' the remaining 4 unique ones are independent of the src bit.
''' They depend on either just the dest bit or on neither
''' the src nor dest bits:
''' d  1  0  1  0  (indep. of s)
''' ~d  0  1  0  1  (indep. of s)
''' CLR   0  0  0  0  (indep. of both s [and] d)
''' SET   1  1  1  1  (indep. of both s [and] d)
''' As mentioned above, three of these are implemented by
''' rasteropUniLow(), and one is a no-op.
''' How can these operation codes be represented by bits
''' in such a way that when the basic operations are performed
''' on the bits the results are unique for unique
''' operations, and mimic the logic table given above?
''' The answer is to choose a particular order of the pairings:
''' (sd) (11) (10) (01) (00)
''' (which happens to be the same as in the above table)
''' and to translate the result into 4-bit representations
''' of s and d.  For example, the Sun rasterop choice
''' (omitting the extra bit for clipping) is
''' PIX_SRC  0xc
''' PIX_DST  0xa
''' This corresponds to our pairing order given above:
''' (sd) (11) (10) (01) (00)
''' where for s = 1 we get the bit pattern
''' PIX_SRC:  1  1  0  0 (0xc)
''' and for d = 1 we get the pattern
''' PIX_DST: 1  0  1  0  (0xa)
''' OK, that's the pairing order that Sun chose.  How many different
''' ways can we assign bit patterns to PIX_SRC and PIX_DST to get
''' the boolean ops to work out?  Any of the 4 pairs can be put
''' in the first position, any of the remaining 3 pairs can go
''' in the second and one of the remaining 2 pairs can go the the third.
''' There is a total of 432 = 24 ways these pairs can be permuted.
