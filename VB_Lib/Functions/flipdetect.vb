''' (2) upconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders<para/>
''' and down ascenders.  The image is analyzed without rotation<para/>
''' for being rightside-up or upside-down.  Set  and upconf to null<para/>
''' to skip this operation.<para/>
''' (3) leftconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders<para/>
''' and down ascenders in the image after it has been<para/>
''' rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  With that rotation, ascenders<para/>
''' projecting to the left in the source image will project up<para/>
''' in the rotated image.  We compute this by rotating 90 degrees<para/>
''' clockwise and testing for up and down ascenders.  Set<para/>
'''  and leftconf to null to skip this operation.<para/>
''' (4) Note that upconf and leftconf are not linear measures of<para/>
''' confidence, e.g., in a range between 0 and 100.  They<para/>
''' measure how far you are out on the tail of a (presumably)<para/>
''' normal distribution.  For example, a confidence of 10 means<para/>
''' that it is nearly certain that the difference did not<para/>
''' happen at random.  However, these values must be interpreted<para/>
''' cautiously, taking into consideration the estimated prior<para/>
''' for a particular orientation or mirror flip. The up-down<para/>
''' signal is very strong if applied to text with ascenders<para/>
''' up and down, and relatively weak for text at 90 degrees,<para/>
''' but even at 90 degrees, the difference can look significant.<para/>
''' For example, suppose the ascenders are oriented horizontally,<para/>
''' but the test is done vertically.  Then upconf can<para/>
''' be  is lower  -MIN_CONF_FOR_UP_DOWN, suggesting the text may be<para/>
''' upside-down.  However, if instead the test were done<para/>
''' horizontally, leftconf will be very much larger<para/>
''' (in absolute value), giving the correct orientation.<para/>
''' (5) If you compute both upconf and leftconf, and there is<para/>
''' sufficient signal, the following table determines the<para/>
''' cw angle necessary to rotate pixs so that the text is<para/>
''' rightside-up:<para/>
''' 0 deg :   upconf  is greater  is greater  1,  abs(upconf)  is greater  is greater  abs(leftconf)<para/>
''' 90 deg :  leftconf  is greater  is greater  1,  abs(leftconf)  is greater  is greater  abs(upconf)<para/>
''' 180 deg : upconf  is lower  is lower  -1, abs(upconf)  is greater  is greater  abs(leftconf)<para/>
''' 270 deg : leftconf  is lower  is lower  -1, abs(leftconf)  is greater  is greater  abs(upconf)<para/>
''' (6) One should probably not interpret the direction unless<para/>
''' there are a sufficient number of counts for both orientations,<para/>
''' in which case neither upconf nor leftconf will be 0.0.<para/>
