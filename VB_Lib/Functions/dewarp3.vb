'''  <summary>
''' (1) This applies the disparity arrays to the specified image.<para/>
'''
'''(2) Specify gray color for pixels brought in from the outside:
'''0 is black, 255 is white.  Use -1 to select pixels from the
'''boundary of the source image.<para/>
'''
'''(3) If the models and ref models have not been validated, this
'''will do so by calling dewarpaInsertRefModels().<para/>
'''
'''(4) This works with both stripped and full resolution page models.
'''If the full res disparity array(s) are missing, they are remade.<para/>
'''
'''(5) The caller must handle errors that are returned because there
'''are no valid models or ref models for the page -- typically
'''by using the input pixs.<para/>
'''
'''(6) If there is no model for %pageno, this will use the model for
''''refpage' and put the result in the dew for %pageno.<para/>
'''
'''(7) This populates the full resolution disparity arrays if
'''necessary.  If x and/or y are positive, they are used,
'''in conjunction with pixs, to determine the required
'''slope-based extension of the full resolution disparity
'''arrays in each direction.  When (x,y) == (0,0), all
'''extension is to the right and down.  Nonzero values of (x,y)
'''are useful for dewarping when pixs is deliberately undercropped.<para/>
'''
'''(8) Important: when applying disparity to a number of images,
'''after calling this function and saving the resulting pixd,
'''you should call dewarpMinimize(dew) on the dew for %pageno.
'''This will remove pixs and pixd (or their clones) stored in dew,
'''as well as the full resolution disparity arrays.  Together,
'''these hold approximately 16 bytes for each pixel in pixs.
