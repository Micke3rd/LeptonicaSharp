'''  <summary>
''' <para/>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' (1) This does rasterop morphology on binary images.<para/>
''' (2) This runs a pipeline of operations no branching is allowed.<para/>
''' (3) This only uses brick Sels, which are created on the fly.<para/>
''' In the future this will be generalized to extract Sels from<para/>
''' a Sela by name.<para/>
''' (4) A new image is always produced the input image is not changed.<para/>
''' (5) This contains an interpreter, allowing sequences to be<para/>
''' generated and run.<para/>
''' (6) The format of the sequence string is defined below.<para/>
''' (7) In addition to morphological operations, rank order reduction<para/>
''' and replicated expansion allow operations to take place<para/>
''' downscaled by a power of 2.<para/>
''' (8) Intermediate results can optionally be displayed.<para/>
''' (9) Thanks to Dar-Shyang Lee, who had the idea for this and<para/>
''' built the first implementation.<para/>
''' (10) The sequence string is formatted as follows:<para/>
''' ~ An arbitrary number of operations,  each separated<para/>
''' by a '+' character.  White space is ignored.<para/>
''' ~ Each operation begins with a case-independent character<para/>
''' specifying the operation:<para/>
''' d or D  (dilation)<para/>
''' e or E  (erosion)<para/>
''' o or O  (opening)<para/>
''' c or C  (closing)<para/>
''' r or R  (rank binary reduction)<para/>
''' x or X  (replicative binary expansion)<para/>
''' b or B  (add a border of 0 pixels of this size)<para/>
''' ~ The args to the morphological operations are bricks of hits,<para/>
''' and are formatted as a.b, where a and b are horizontal and<para/>
''' vertical dimensions, rsp.<para/>
''' ~ The args to the reduction are a sequence of up to 4 integers,<para/>
''' each from 1 to 4.<para/>
''' ~ The arg to the expansion is a power of two, in the set<para/>
''' {2, 4, 8, 16}.<para/>
''' (11) An example valid sequence is:<para/>
''' "b32 + o1.3 + C3.1 + r23 + e2.2 + D3.2 + X4"<para/>
''' In this example, the following operation sequence is carried out:<para/>
''' b32: Add a 32 pixel border around the input image<para/>
''' o1.3: Opening with vert sel of length 3 (e.g., 1 x 3)<para/>
''' C3.1: Closing with horiz sel of length 3  (e.g., 3 x 1)<para/>
''' r23: Two successive 2x2 reductions with rank 2 in the first<para/>
''' and rank 3 in the second.  The result is a 4x reduced pix.<para/>
''' e2.2: Erosion with a 2x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 0,0)<para/>
''' d3.2: Dilation with a 3x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 1,0)<para/>
''' X4: 4x replicative expansion, back to original resolution<para/>
''' (12) The safe closing is used.  However, if you implement a<para/>
''' closing as separable dilations followed by separable erosions,<para/>
''' it will not be safe.  For that situation, you need to add<para/>
''' a sufficiently large border as the first operation in<para/>
''' the sequence.  This will be removed automatically at the<para/>
''' end.  There are two cautions:<para/>
''' ~ When computing what is sufficient, remember that if<para/>
''' reductions are carried out, the border is also reduced.<para/>
''' ~ The border is removed at the end, so if a border is<para/>
''' added at the beginning, the result must be at the<para/>
''' same resolution as the input!<para/>
