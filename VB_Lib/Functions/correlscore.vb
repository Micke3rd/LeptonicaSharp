''' Notes:<para/>
''' We check first that the two pix are roughly the same size.<para/>
''' For jbclass (jbig2) applications at roughly 300 ppi, maxdiffw and<para/>
''' maxdiffh should be at least 2.<para/>
''' Only if they meet that criterion do we compare the bitmaps.<para/>
''' The centroid difference is used to align the two images to the<para/>
''' nearest integer for the correlation.<para/>
''' The correlation score is the ratio of the square of the number of<para/>
''' pixels in the AND of the two bitmaps to the product of the number<para/>
''' of ON pixels in each.  Denote the number of ON pixels in pix1<para/>
''' by |1|, the number in pix2 by |2|, and the number in the AND<para/>
''' of pix1 and pix2 by |1  and  2|.  The correlation score is then<para/>
''' (|1  and  2|)2 / (|1||2|).<para/>
''' This score is compared with an input threshold, which can<para/>
''' be modified depending on the weight of the template.<para/>
''' The modified threshold is<para/>
''' thresh + (1.0 - thresh)  weight  R<para/>
''' where<para/>
''' weight is a fixed input factor between 0.0 and 1.0<para/>
''' R = |2| / area(2)<para/>
''' and area(2) is the total number of pixels in 2 (i.e., width x height).<para/>
''' To understand why a weight factor is useful, consider what happens<para/>
''' with thick, sans-serif characters that look similar and have a value<para/>
''' of R near 1.  Different characters can have a high correlation value,<para/>
''' and the classifier will make incorrect substitutions.  The weight<para/>
''' factor raises the threshold for these characters.<para/>
''' Yet another approach to reduce such substitutions is to run the classifier<para/>
''' in a non-greedy way, matching to the template with the highest<para/>
''' score, not the first template with a score satisfying the matching<para/>
''' constraint.  However, this is not particularly effective.<para/>
''' The implementation here gives the same result as in<para/>
''' pixCorrelationScoreSimple(), where a temporary Pix is made to hold<para/>
''' the AND and implementation uses rasterop:<para/>
''' pixt = pixCreateTemplate(pix1)<para/>
''' pixRasterop(pixt, idelx, idely, wt, ht, PIX_SRC, pix2, 0, 0)<para/>

''' However, here it is done in a streaming fashion, counting as it goes,<para/>
