'''  <summary>
''' <para/>
''' I found one description in the literature of octree color<para/>
''' quantization, using progressive truncation of the octree,<para/>
''' by M. Gervautz and W. Purgathofer in Graphics Gems, pp.<para/>
''' 287-293, ed. A. Glassner, Academic Press, 1990.<para/>
''' Rather than setting up a fixed partitioning of the color<para/>
''' space ab initio, as we do here, they allow the octree to be<para/>
''' progressively truncated as new pixels are added.  They<para/>
''' need to set up some data structures that are traversed<para/>
''' with the addition of each 24 bit pixel, in order to decide<para/>
''' either 1) in which cluster (sub-branch of the octree to put<para/>
''' the pixel, or 2 whether to truncate the octree further<para/>
''' to place the pixel in an existing cluster, or 3 which<para/>
''' two existing clusters should be merged so that the pixel<para/>
''' can be left to start a truncated leaf of the octree.  Such dynamic<para/>
''' truncation is considerably more complicated, and Gervautz et<para/>
''' al. did not explain how they did it in anywhere near the<para/>
''' detail required to check their implementation.<para/>
''' The simple method in pixFixedOctcubeQuant256 is very<para/>
''' fast, and with dithering the results are good, but you<para/>
''' can do better if the color clusters are selected adaptively<para/>
''' from the image.  We want a method that makes much better<para/>
''' use of color samples in regions of color space with high<para/>
''' pixel density, while also fairly representing small numbers<para/>
''' of color pixels in low density regions.  Such adaptation<para/>
''' requires two passes through the image: the first for generating<para/>
''' the pruned tree of color cubes and the second for computing the index<para/>
''' into the color table for each pixel.<para/>
''' A relatively simple adaptive method is pixOctreeQuantByPopulation.<para/>
''' That function first determines if the image has very few colors,<para/>
''' and, if so, quantizes to those colors.  If there are more than<para/>
''' 256 colors, it generates a histogram of octcube leaf occupancy<para/>
''' at level 4, chooses the 192 most populated such leaves as<para/>
''' the first 192 colors, and sets the remaining 64 colors to the<para/>
''' residual average pixel values in each of the 64 level 2 octcubes.<para/>
''' This is a bit faster than pixOctreeColorQuant, and does very<para/>
''' well without dithering, but for most images with dithering it<para/>
''' is clearly inferior.<para/>
''' We now describe pixOctreeColorQuant.  The first pass is done<para/>
''' on a subsampled image, because we do not need to use all the<para/>
''' pixels in the image to generate the tree.  Subsampling<para/>
''' down to 0.25 1/16 of the pixels makes the program run<para/>
''' about 1.3 times faster.<para/>
''' Instead of dividing the color space into 256 equal-sized<para/>
''' regions, we initially divide it into 2^12 or 2^15 or 2^18<para/>
''' equal-sized octcubes.  Suppose we choose to use 2^18 octcubes.<para/>
''' This gives us 6 octree levels.  We then prune back,<para/>
''' starting from level 6.  For every cube at level 6, there<para/>
''' are 8 cubes at level 5.  Call the operation of putting a<para/>
''' cube aside as a color table entry CTE a "saving."<para/>
''' We use a in general level-dependent threshold, and save<para/>
''' those level 6 cubes that are above threshold.<para/>
''' The rest are combined into the containing level 5 cube.<para/>
''' If between 1 and 7 level 6 cubes within a level 5<para/>
''' cube have been saved by thresholding, then the remaining<para/>
''' level 6 cubes in that level 5 cube are automatically<para/>
''' saved as well, without applying a threshold.  This greatly<para/>
''' simplifies both the description of the CTEs and the later<para/>
''' classification of each pixel as belonging to a CTE.<para/>
''' This procedure is iterated through every cube, starting at<para/>
''' level 5, and then 4, 3, and 2, successively.  The result is that<para/>
''' each CTE contains the entirety of a set of from 1 to 7 cubes<para/>
''' from a given level that all belong to a single cube at the<para/>
''' level above. We classify the CTEs in terms of the<para/>
''' condition in which they are made as either being "threshold"<para/>
''' or "residual."  They are "threshold" CTEs if no subcubes<para/>
''' are CTEs that is, they contain every pixel within the cube<para/>
''' and the number of pixels exceeds the threshold for making<para/>
''' a CTE.  They are "residual" CTEs if at least one but not more<para/>
''' than 7 of the subcubes have already been determined to be CTEs<para/>
''' this happens automatically -- no threshold is applied.<para/>
''' If all 8 subcubes are determined to be CTEs, the cube is<para/>
''' marked as having all pixels accounted for 'bleaf' = 1 but<para/>
''' is not saved as a CTE.<para/>
''' We stop the pruning at level 2, at which there are 64<para/>
''' sub-cubes.  Any pixels not already claimed in a CTE are<para/>
''' put in these cubes.<para/>
''' As the cubes are saved as color samples in the color table,<para/>
''' the number of remaining pixels P and the number of<para/>
''' remaining colors in the color table N are recomputed,<para/>
''' along with the average number of pixels P/N ppc to go in<para/>
''' each of the remaining colors.  This running average number is<para/>
''' used to set the threshold at the current level.<para/>
''' Because we are going to very small cubes at levels 6 or 5,<para/>
''' and will dither the colors for errors, it is not necessary<para/>
''' to compute the color center of each cluster we can simply<para/>
''' use the center of the cube.  This gives us a minimax error<para/>
''' condition: the maximum error is half the width of the<para/>
''' level 2 cubes -- 32 color values out of 256 -- for each color<para/>
''' sample.  In practice, most of the pixels will be very much<para/>
''' closer to the center of their cells.  And with dithering,<para/>
''' the average pixel color in a small region will be closer still.<para/>
''' Thus with the octree quantizer, we are able to capture<para/>
''' regions of high color pdf probability density function in small<para/>
''' but accurate CTEs, and to have only a small number of pixels<para/>
''' that end up a significant distance with a guaranteed maximum<para/>
''' from their true color.<para/>
''' How should the threshold factor vary?  Threshold factors<para/>
''' are required for levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the pruning stage.<para/>
''' The threshold for level 5 is actually applied to cubes at<para/>
''' level 6, etc.  From various experiments, it appears that<para/>
''' the results do not vary appreciably for threshold values near 1.0.<para/>
''' If you want more colors in smaller cubes, the threshold<para/>
''' factors can be set lower than 1.0 for cubes at levels 4 and 5.<para/>
''' However, if the factor is set much lower than 1.0 for<para/>
''' levels 2 and 3, we can easily run out of colors.<para/>
''' We put aside 64 colors in the calculation of the threshold<para/>
''' values, because we must have 64 color centers at level 2,<para/>
''' that will have very few pixels in most of them.<para/>
''' If we reduce the factor for level 5 to 0.4, this will<para/>
''' generate many level 6 CTEs, and consequently<para/>
''' many residual cells will be formed up from those leaves,<para/>
''' resulting in the possibility of running out of colors.<para/>
''' Remember, the residual CTEs are mandatory, and are formed<para/>
''' without using the threshold, regardless of the number of<para/>
''' pixels that are absorbed.<para/>
''' The implementation logically has four parts:<para/>
''' 1 accumulation into small, fixed cells<para/>
''' 2 pruning back into selected CTE cubes<para/>
''' 3 organizing the CTEs for fast search to find<para/>
''' the CTE to which any image pixel belongs<para/>
''' 4 doing a second scan to code the image pixels by CTE<para/>
''' Step 1 is straightforward we use 2^15 cells.<para/>
''' We've already discussed how the pruning step 2 will be performed.<para/>
''' Steps 3) and (4 are related, in that the organization<para/>
''' used by step 3 determines how the search actually<para/>
''' takes place for each pixel in step 4.<para/>
''' There are many ways to do step 3.  Let's explore a few.<para/>
''' a The simplest is to order the cubes from highest occupancy<para/>
''' to lowest, and traverse the list looking for the deepest<para/>
''' match.  To make this more efficient, so that we know when<para/>
''' to stop looking, any cube that has separate CTE subcubes<para/>
''' would be marked as such, so that we know when we hit a<para/>
''' true leaf.<para/>
''' b Alternatively, we can order the cubes by highest<para/>
''' occupancy separately each level, and work upward,<para/>
''' starting at level 5, so that when we find a match we<para/>
''' know that it will be correct.<para/>
''' c Another approach would be to order the cubes by<para/>
''' "address" and use a hash table to find the cube<para/>
''' corresponding to a pixel color.  I don't know how to<para/>
''' do this with a variable length address, as each CTE<para/>
''' will have 3n bits, where n is the level.<para/>
''' d Another approach entirely is to put the CTE cubes into<para/>
''' a tree, in such a way that starting from the root, and<para/>
''' using 3 bits of address at a time, the correct branch of<para/>
''' each octree can be taken until a leaf is found.  Because<para/>
''' a given cube can be both a leaf and also have branches<para/>
''' going to sub-cubes, the search stops only when no<para/>
''' marked subcubes have addresses that match the given pixel.<para/>
''' In the tree method, we can start with a dense infrastructure,<para/>
''' and place the leaves corresponding to the N colors<para/>
''' in the tree, or we can grow from the root only those<para/>
''' branches that end directly on leaves.<para/>
''' What we do here is to take approach d, and implement the tree<para/>
''' "virtually", as a set of arrays, one array for each level<para/>
''' of the tree. Initially we start at level 5, an array with<para/>
''' 2^15 cubes, each with 8 subcubes.  We then build nodes at<para/>
''' levels closer to the root at level 4 there are 2^12 nodes<para/>
''' each with 8 subcubes etc.  Using these arrays has<para/>
''' several advantages:<para/>
''' ~  We don't need to keep track of links between cubes<para/>
''' and subcubes, because we can use the canonical<para/>
''' addressing on the cell arrays directly to determine<para/>
''' which nodes are parent cubes and which are sub-cubes.<para/>
''' ~  We can prune directly on this tree<para/>
''' ~  We can navigate the pruned tree quickly to classify<para/>
''' each pixel in the image.<para/>
''' Canonical addressing guarantees that the i-th node at level k<para/>
''' has 8 subnodes given by the 8i ... 8i+7 nodes at level k+1.<para/>
''' The pruning step works as follows.  We go from the lowest<para/>
''' level up.  At each level, the threshold is found from the<para/>
''' product of a factor near 1.0 and the ratio of unmarked pixels<para/>
''' to remaining colors minus the 64.  We march through<para/>
''' the space, sequentially considering a cube and its 8 subcubes.<para/>
''' We first check those subcubes that are not already<para/>
''' marked as CTE to see if any are above threshold, and if so,<para/>
''' generate a CTE and mark them as such.<para/>
''' We then determine if any of the subcubes have been marked.<para/>
''' If so, and there are subcubes that are not marked,<para/>
''' we generate a CTE for the cube from the remaining unmarked<para/>
''' subcubes this is mandatory and does not depend on how many<para/>
''' pixels are in the set of subcubes.  If none of the subcubes<para/>
''' are marked, we aggregate their pixels into the cube<para/>
''' containing them, but do not mark it as a CTE that<para/>
''' will be determined when iterating through the next level up.<para/>
''' When all the pixels in a cube are accounted for in one or more<para/>
''' colors, we set the boolean 'bleaf' to true.  This is the<para/>
''' flag used to mark the cubes in the pruning step.  If a cube<para/>
''' is marked, and all 8 subcubes are marked, then it is not<para/>
''' itself given a CTE because all pixels have already been<para/>
''' accounted for.<para/>
''' Note that the pruning of the tree and labelling of the CTEs<para/>
''' step 2 accomplishes step 3 implicitly, because the marked<para/>
''' and pruned tree is ready for use in labelling each pixel<para/>
''' in step 4.  We now, for every pixel in the image, traverse<para/>
''' the tree from the root, looking for the lowest cube that is a leaf.<para/>
''' At each level we have a cube and subcube.  If we reach a subcube<para/>
''' leaf that is marked 0, we know that the color is stored in the<para/>
''' cube above, and we've found the CTE.  Otherwise, the subcube<para/>
''' leaf is marked 1.  If we're at the last level, we've reached<para/>
''' the final leaf and must use it.  Otherwise, continue the<para/>
''' process at the next level down.<para/>
''' For robustness, efficiency and high quality output, we do the following:<para/>
''' (1) Measure the color content of the image.  If there is very little<para/>
''' color, quantize in grayscale.<para/>
''' (2) For efficiency, build the octree with a subsampled image if the<para/>
''' image is larger than some threshold size.<para/>
''' (3) Reserve an extra set of colors to prevent running out of colors<para/>
''' when pruning the octree specifically, during the assignment<para/>
''' of those level 2 cells out of the 64 that have unassigned<para/>
''' pixels.  The problem of running out is more likely to happen<para/>
''' with small images, because the estimation we use for the<para/>
''' number of pixels available is not accurate.<para/>
''' (4) In the unlikely event that we run out of colors, the dithered<para/>
''' image can be very poor.  As this would only happen with very<para/>
''' small images, and dithering is not particularly noticeable with<para/>
''' such images, turn it off.<para/>

''' Notes:<para/>
''' (1) This color quantization method works very well without<para/>
''' dithering, using octcubes at two different levels:<para/>
''' (a) the input %level, which is either 3 or 4<para/>
''' (b) level 2 (64 octcubes to cover the entire color space)<para/>
''' (2) For best results, using %level = 4 is recommended.<para/>
''' Why do we provide an option for using level 3?  Because<para/>
''' there are 512 octcubes at level 3, and for many images<para/>
''' not more than 256 are filled.  As a result, on some images<para/>
''' a very accurate quantized representation is possible using<para/>
''' %level = 3.<para/>
''' (3) This first breaks up the color space into octcubes at the<para/>
''' input %level, and computes, for each octcube, the average<para/>
''' value of the pixels that are in it.<para/>
''' (4) Then there are two possible situations:<para/>
''' (a) If there are not more than 256 populated octcubes,<para/>
''' it returns a cmapped pix with those values assigned.<para/>
''' (b) Otherwise, it selects 192 octcubes containing the largest<para/>
''' number of pixels and quantizes pixels within those octcubes<para/>
''' to their average.  Then, to handle the residual pixels<para/>
''' that are not in those 192 octcubes, it generates a<para/>
''' level 2 octree consisting of 64 octcubes, and within<para/>
''' each octcube it quantizes the residual pixels to their<para/>
''' average within each of those level 2 octcubes.<para/>
''' (5) Unpopulated level 2 octcubes are represented in the colormap<para/>
''' by their centers.  This, of course, has no effect unless<para/>
''' dithering is used for the output image.<para/>
''' (6) The depth of pixd is the minimum required to support the<para/>
''' number of colors found at %level namely, 2, 4 or 8.<para/>
''' (7) This function works particularly well on images such as maps,<para/>
''' where there are a relatively small number of well-populated<para/>
''' colors, but due to antialiasing and compression artifacts<para/>
''' there may be a large number of different colors.  This will<para/>
''' pull out and represent accurately the highly populated colors,<para/>
''' while still making a reasonable approximation for the others.<para/>
''' (8) The highest level of octcubes allowed is 4.  Use of higher<para/>
''' levels typically results in having a small fraction of<para/>
''' pixels in the most populated 192 octcubes.  As a result,<para/>
''' most of the pixels are represented at level 2, which is<para/>
''' not sufficiently accurate.<para/>
''' (9) Dithering shows artifacts on some images.  If you plan to<para/>

'''  <summary>
''' <para/>
''' pixOctreeColorQuant is very flexible in terms of the relative<para/>
''' depth of different cubes of the octree. By contrast, this function,<para/>
''' pixOctreeQuantNumColors is also adaptive, but it supports octcube<para/>
''' leaves at only two depths: a smaller depth that guarantees<para/>
''' full coverage of the color space and octcubes at one level<para/>
''' deeper for more accurate colors.  Its main virutes are simplicity<para/>
''' and speed, which are both derived from the natural indexing of<para/>
''' the octcubes from the RGB values.<para/>
''' Before describing pixOctreeQuantNumColors, consider an even simpler<para/>
''' approach for 4 bpp with either 8 or 16 colors.  With 8 colors,<para/>
''' you simply go to level 1 octcubes and use the average color<para/>
''' found in each cube.  For 16 colors, you find which of the three<para/>
''' colors has the largest variance at the second level, and use two<para/>
''' indices for that color.  The result is quite poor, because 1 some<para/>
''' of the cubes are nearly empty and 2 you don't get much color<para/>
''' differentiation for the extra 8 colors.  Trust me, this method may<para/>
''' be simple, but it isn't worth anything.<para/>
''' In pixOctreeQuantNumColors, we generate colormapped images at<para/>
''' either 4 bpp or 8 bpp.  For 4 bpp, we have a minimum of 8 colors<para/>
''' for the level 1 octcubes, plus up to 8 additional colors that<para/>
''' are determined from the level 2 popularity.  If the number of colors<para/>
''' is between 8 and 16, the output is a 4 bpp image.  If the number of<para/>
''' colors is greater than 16, the output is a 8 bpp image.<para/>
''' We use a priority queue, implemented with a heap, to select the<para/>
''' requisite number of most populated octcubes at the deepest level<para/>
''' level 2 for 64 or fewer colors level 3 for more than 64 colors.<para/>
''' These are combined with one color for each octcube one level above,<para/>
''' which is used to span the color space of octcubes that were not<para/>
''' included at the deeper level.<para/>
''' If the deepest level is 2, we combine the popular level 2 octcubes<para/>
''' out of a total of 64 with the 8 level 1 octcubes.  If the deepest<para/>
''' level is 3, we combine the popular level 3 octcubes out of a<para/>
''' total 512 with the 64 level 2 octcubes that span the color space.<para/>
''' In the latter case, we require a minimum of 64 colors for the level 2<para/>
''' octcubes, plus up to 192 additional colors determined from level 3<para/>
''' popularity.<para/>
''' The parameter 'maxlevel' is the deepest octcube level that is used.<para/>
''' The implementation also uses two LUTs, which are employed in<para/>
''' two successive traversals of the dest image.  The first maps<para/>
''' from the src octindex at 'maxlevel' to the color table index,<para/>
''' which is the value that is stored in the 4 or 8 bpp dest pixel.<para/>
''' The second LUT maps from that colormap value in the dest to a<para/>
''' new colormap value for a minimum sized colormap, stored back in<para/>
''' the dest.  It is used to remove any color map entries that<para/>
''' correspond to color space regions that have no pixels in the<para/>
''' source image.  These regions can be either from the higher level<para/>
''' e.g., level 1 for 4 bpp, or from octcubes at 'maxlevel' that<para/>
''' are unoccupied.  This remapping results in the minimum number<para/>
''' of colors used according to the constraints induced by the<para/>
''' input 'maxcolors'.  We also compute the average R, G and B color<para/>
''' values in each region of the color space represented by a<para/>
''' colormap entry, and store them in the colormap.<para/>
''' The maximum number of colors is input, which determines the<para/>
''' following properties of the dest image and octcube regions used:<para/>
''' Number of colors  dest image depth  maxlevel<para/>
''' ----------------  ----------------  --------<para/>
''' 8 to 16  4 bpp   2<para/>
''' 17 to 64   8 bpp   2<para/>
''' 65 to 256  8 bpp   3<para/>
''' It may turn out that the number of extra colors, beyond the<para/>
''' minimum 8 and 64 for maxlevel 2 and 3, respectively, is larger<para/>
''' than the actual number of occupied cubes at these levels<para/>
''' In that case, all the pixels are contained in this<para/>
''' subset of cubes at maxlevel, and no colormap colors are needed<para/>
''' to represent the remainder pixels one level above.  Thus, for<para/>
''' example, in use one often finds that the pixels in an image<para/>
''' occupy less than 192 octcubes at level 3, so they can be represented<para/>

''' Notes:<para/>
''' This simple 1-pass color quantization works by breaking the<para/>
''' color space into 256 pieces, with 3 bits quantized for each of<para/>
''' red and green, and 2 bits quantized for blue.  We shortchange<para/>
''' blue because the eye is least sensitive to blue.  This<para/>
''' division of the color space is into two levels of octrees,<para/>
''' followed by a further division by 4 not 8, where both<para/>
''' blue octrees have been combined in the third level.<para/>
''' The color map is generated from the 256 color centers by<para/>
''' taking the representative color to be the center of the<para/>
''' cell volume.  This gives a maximum error in the red and<para/>
''' green values of 16 levels, and a maximum error in the<para/>
''' blue sample of 32 levels.<para/>
''' Each pixel in the 24-bit color image is placed in its containing<para/>
''' cell, given by the relevant MSbits of the red, green and blue<para/>
''' samples.  An error-diffusion dithering is performed on each<para/>
''' color sample to give the appearance of good average local color.<para/>
''' Dithering is required without it, the contouring and visible<para/>
''' color errors are very bad.<para/>
''' I originally implemented this algorithm in two passes,<para/>
''' where the first pass was used to compute the weighted average<para/>
''' of each sample in each pre-allocated region of color space.<para/>
''' The idea was to use these centroids in the dithering algorithm<para/>
''' of the second pass, to reduce the average error that was<para/>
''' being dithered.  However, with dithering, there is<para/>
''' virtually no difference, so there is no reason to make the<para/>
''' first pass.  Consequently, this 1-pass version just assigns<para/>
''' the pixels to the centers of the pre-allocated cells.<para/>
''' We use dithering to spread the difference between the sample<para/>
''' value and the location of the center of the cell.  For speed<para/>
''' and simplicity, we use integer dithering and propagate only<para/>
''' to the right, down, and diagonally down-right, with ratios<para/>
''' 3/8, 3/8 and 1/4, respectively.  The results should be nearly<para/>
''' as good, and a bit faster, with propagation only to the right<para/>
''' and down.<para/>
''' The algorithm is very fast, because there is no search,<para/>
''' only fast generation of the cell index for each pixel.<para/>
''' We use a simple mapping from the three 8 bit rgb samples<para/>
''' to the 8 bit cell index namely, r7 r6 r5 g7 g6 g5 b7 b6.<para/>
''' This is not in an octcube format, but it doesn't matter.<para/>
''' There are no storage requirements.  We could keep a<para/>
''' running average of the center of each sample in each<para/>
''' cluster, rather than using the center of the cell, but<para/>
''' this is just extra work, esp. with dithering.<para/>
''' This method gives surprisingly good results with dithering.<para/>
''' However, without dithering, the loss of color accuracy is<para/>

''' in the colormap.  The higher the level of the octtree, the smaller<para/>
''' the octcubes in the color space, and hence the more accurately<para/>
''' we can determine the closest color in the colormap however,<para/>
''' the size of the LUT, which is the total number of octcubes,<para/>
''' increases by a factor of 8 for each increase of 1 level.<para/>
''' The time required to acquire a level 4 mapping table, which has<para/>
''' about 4K entries, is less than 1 msec, so that is the<para/>
''' recommended minimum size to be used.  At that size, the<para/>
''' octcubes have their centers 16 units apart in each (r,g,b)<para/>
''' direction.  If two colors are in the same octcube, the one<para/>
''' closest to the center will always be chosen.  The maximum<para/>
''' error for any component occurs when the correct color is<para/>
''' at a cube corner and there is an incorrect color just inside<para/>
''' the cube next to the opposite corner, giving an error of<para/>
''' 14 units (out of 256) for each component. Using a level 5<para/>
''' mapping table reduces the maximum error to 6 units.<para/>
''' (3) Typically you should use the Euclidean metric, because the<para/>
''' resulting voronoi cells (which are generated using the actual<para/>
''' colormap values as seeds) are convex for Euclidean distance<para/>
''' but not for Manhattan distance.  In terms of the octcubes,<para/>
''' convexity of the voronoi cells means that if the 8 corners<para/>
''' of any cube (of which the octcubes are special cases)<para/>
''' are all within a cell, then every point in the cube will<para/>
''' lie within the cell.<para/>
''' (4) The depth of the output pixd is equal to the maximum of<para/>
''' (a) %mindepth and (b) the minimum (2, 4 or 8 bpp) necessary<para/>
''' to hold the indices in the colormap.<para/>
''' (5) We build a mapping table from octcube to colormap index so<para/>
''' that this function can run in a time (otherwise) independent<para/>
''' of the number of colors in the colormap.  This avoids a<para/>
''' brute-force search for the closest colormap color to each<para/>
''' pixel in the image.<para/>
''' (6) This is similar to the function pixAssignToNearestColor()<para/>
''' used for color segmentation.<para/>
''' (7) Except for very small images or when using level  is greater  4,<para/>
''' it takes very little time to generate the tables,<para/>
''' compared to the generation of the colormapped dest pix,<para/>
''' so one would not typically use the low-level version.<para/>

''' <para/>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' (1) This function is used to quickly find the colormap color<para/>
''' that is closest to any rgb color.  It is used to assign<para/>
''' rgb colors to an existing colormap.  It can be very expensive<para/>
''' to search through the entire colormap for the closest color<para/>
''' to each pixel.  Instead, we first set up this table, which is<para/>
''' populated by the colormap index nearest to each octcube<para/>
''' color.  Then we go through the image for each pixel,<para/>
''' do two table lookups: first to generate the octcube index<para/>
''' from rgb and second to use this table to read out the<para/>
''' colormap index.<para/>
''' (2) Do a slight modification for white and black.  For level = 4,<para/>
''' each octcube size is 16.  The center of the whitest octcube<para/>
''' is at (248, 248, 248), which is closer to 242 than 255.<para/>
''' Consequently, any gray color between 242 and 254 will<para/>
''' be selected, even if white (255, 255, 255) exists.  This is<para/>
''' typically not optimal, because the original color was<para/>
''' likely white.  Therefore, if white exists in the colormap,<para/>
''' use it for any rgb color that falls into the most white octcube.<para/>
''' Do the similar thing for black.<para/>
''' (3) Here are the actual function calls for quantizing to a<para/>
''' specified colormap:<para/>
''' ~ first make the tables that map from rgb -- is greater  octcube index<para/>
''' makeRGBToIndexTables()<para/>
''' ~ then for each pixel:<para/>
''' use the tables to get the octcube index<para/>
''' getOctcubeIndexFromRGB()<para/>
''' use this table to get the nearest color in the colormap<para/>
''' cmap_index = tab[index]<para/>
''' (4) Distance can be either manhattan or euclidean.<para/>
''' (5) In typical use, level = 4 gives reasonable results, and<para/>
''' level = 5 is slightly better.  When this function is used<para/>
''' for color segmentation, there are typically a small number<para/>
''' of colors and the number of levels can be small (e.g., level = 3).<para/>
