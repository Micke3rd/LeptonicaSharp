'''  <summary>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' 
''' (1) If called from pixWriteStream(), the stream is positioned
''' at the beginning of the file.<para/>
''' 
''' (2) To do sequential writes of png format images to a stream,
''' use pixWriteStreamPng() directly.<para/>
''' 
''' (3) gamma is an optional png chunk.  If no gamma value is to be
''' placed into the file, use gamma = 0.0.  Otherwise, if
''' gamma  is greater  0.0, its value is written into the header.<para/>
''' 
''' (4) The use of gamma in png is highly problematic.  For an illuminating
''' discussion, see:  http://hsivonen.iki.fi/png-gamma/<para/>
''' 
''' (5) What is the effect/meaning of gamma in the png file?  This
''' gamma, which we can call the 'source' gamma, is the
''' inverse of the gamma that was used in enhance.c to brighten
''' or darken images.  The 'source' gamma is supposed to indicate
''' the intensity mapping that was done at the time the
''' image was captured.  Display programs typically apply a
''' 'display' gamma of 2.2 to the output, which is intended
''' to linearize the intensity based on the response of
''' thermionic tubes (CRTs).  Flat panel LCDs have typically
''' been designed to give a similar response as CRTs (call it
''' "backward compatibility").  The 'display' gamma is
''' in some sense the inverse of the 'source' gamma.
''' jpeg encoders attached to scanners and cameras will lighten
''' the pixels, applying a gamma corresponding to approximately
''' a square-root relation of output vs input:
''' output = input^(gamma)
''' where gamma is often set near 0.4545  (1/gamma is 2.2).
''' This is stored in the image file.  Then if the display
''' program reads the gamma, it will apply a display gamma,
''' typically about 2.2 the product is 1.0, and the
''' display program produces a linear output.  This works because
''' the dark colors were appropriately boosted by the scanner,
''' as described by the 'source' gamma, so they should not
''' be further boosted by the display program.<para/>
''' 
''' (6) As an example, with xv and display, if no gamma is stored,
''' the program acts as if gamma were 0.4545, multiplies this by 2.2,
''' and does a linear rendering.  Taking this as a baseline
''' brightness, if the stored gamma is:
'''  is greater  0.4545, the image is rendered lighter than baseline
'''  is smaller 0.4545, the image is rendered darker than baseline
''' In contrast, gqview seems to ignore the gamma chunk in png.<para/>
''' 
''' (7) The only valid pixel depths in leptonica are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
''' and 32.  However, it is possible, and in some cases desirable,
''' to write out a png file using an rgb pix that has 24 bpp.
''' For example, the open source xpdf SplashBitmap class generates
''' 24 bpp rgb images.  Consequently, we enable writing 24 bpp pix.
''' To generate such a pix, you can make a 24 bpp pix without data
''' and assign the data array to the pix e.g.,
''' pix = pixCreateHeader(w, h, 24)
''' pixSetData(pix, rgbdata)
''' See pixConvert32To24() for an example, where we get rgbdata
''' from the 32 bpp pix.  Caution: do not call pixSetPadBits(),
''' because the alignment is wrong and you may erase part of the
''' last pixel on each line.<para/>
''' 
''' (8) If the pix has a colormap, it is written to file.  In most
''' situations, the alpha component is 255 for each colormap entry,
''' which is opaque and indicates that it should be ignored.
''' However, if any alpha component is not 255, it is assumed that
''' the alpha values are valid, and they are written to the png
''' file in a tRNS segment.  On readback, the tRNS segment is
''' identified, and the colormapped image with alpha is converted
''' to a 4 spp rgba image.
