'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This applies the disparity arrays to the specified image.
''' (2) Specify gray color for pixels brought in from the outside
''' 0 is black, 255 is white.  Use -1 to select pixels from the
''' boundary of the source image.
''' (3) If the models and ref models have not been validated, this
''' will do so by calling dewarpaInsertRefModels().
''' (4) This works with both stripped and full resolution page models.
''' If the full res disparity array(s) are missing, they are remade.
''' (5) The caller must handle errors that are returned because there
''' are no valid models or ref models for the page -- typically
''' by using the input pixs.
''' (6) If there is no model for %pageno, this will use the model for
''' 'refpage' and put the result in the dew for %pageno.
''' (7) This populates the full resolution disparity arrays if
''' necessary.  If x and/or y are positive, they are used,
''' in conjunction with pixs, to determine the required
''' slope-based extension of the full resolution disparity
''' arrays in each direction.  When (x,y) == (0,0), all
''' extension is to the right and down.  Nonzero values of (x,y)
''' are useful for dewarping when pixs is deliberately undercropped.
''' (8) Important when applying disparity to a number of images,
''' after calling this function and saving the resulting pixd,
''' you should call dewarpMinimize(dew) on the dew for %pageno.
''' This will remove pixs and pixd (or their clones) stored in dew,
''' as well as the full resolution disparity arrays.  Together,
''' these hold approximately 16 bytes for each pixel in pixs.

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) If the full resolution vertical and horizontal disparity
''' arrays do not exist, they are built from the subsampled ones.
''' (2) If pixs is not given, the size of the arrays is determined
''' by the original image from which the sampled version was
''' generated.  Any values of (x,y) are ignored.
''' (3) If pixs is given, the full resolution disparity arrays must
''' be large enough to accommodate it.
''' (a) If the arrays do not exist, the value of (x,y) determines
''' the origin of the full resolution arrays without extension,
''' relative to pixs.  Thus, (x,y) gives the amount of
''' slope extension in (left, top).  The (right, bottom)
''' extension is then determined by the size of pixs and
''' (x,y); the values should never be LT 0.
''' (b) If the arrays exist and pixs is too large, the existing
''' full res arrays are destroyed and new ones are made,
''' again using (x,y) to determine the extension in the
''' four directions.
