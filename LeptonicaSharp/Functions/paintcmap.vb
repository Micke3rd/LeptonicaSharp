'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This is an in-place operation.
''' (2) It sets all pixels in region that have the color specified
''' by the colormap index 'sindex' to the new color.
''' (3) sindex must be in the existing colormap; otherwise an
''' error is returned.
''' (4) If the new color exists in the colormap, it is used;
''' otherwise, it is added to the colormap.  If it cannot be
''' added because the colormap is full, an error is returned.
''' (5) If box is NULL, applies function to the entire image; otherwise,
''' clips the operation to the intersection of the box and pix.
''' (6) An example of use would be to set to a specific color all
''' the light (background) pixels within a certain region of
''' a 3-level 2 bpp image, while leaving light pixels outside
''' this region unchanged.

''' (1) This is an in-place operation.
