'''  <summary>
''' <para/>
''' Notes:<para/>
''' (1) The horizontal and vertical lines along which elements are<para/>
''' selected are roughly equally spaced.  The actual locations of<para/>
''' the hits and misses are the centers of respective run-lengths.<para/>
''' (2) No elements are selected that are less than 'distance' pixels away<para/>
''' from a boundary pixel of the same color.  This makes the<para/>
''' match much more robust to edge noise.  Valid inputs of<para/>
''' 'distance' are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If distance is either 0 or<para/>
''' greater than 4, we reset it to the default value.<para/>
''' (3) The 4 numbers for adding rectangles of pixels outside the fg<para/>
''' can be use if the pattern is expected to be surrounded by bg<para/>
''' (white) pixels.  On the other hand, if the pattern may be near<para/>
''' other fg (black) components on some sides, use 0 for those sides.<para/>
''' (4) The pixels added to a side allow you to have miss elements there.<para/>
''' There is a constraint between distance, minlength, and<para/>
''' the added pixels for this to work.  We illustrate using the<para/>
''' default values.  If you add 5 pixels to the top, and use a<para/>
''' distance of 1, then you end up with a vertical run of at least<para/>
''' 4 bg pixels along the top edge of the image.  If you use a<para/>
''' minimum runlength of 3, each vertical line will always find<para/>
''' a miss near the center of its run.  However, if you use a<para/>
''' minimum runlength of 5, you will not get a miss on every vertical<para/>
''' line.  As another example, if you have 7 added pixels and a<para/>
''' distance of 2, you can use a runlength up to 5 to guarantee<para/>
''' that the miss element is recorded.  We give a warning if the<para/>
''' constraint does not guarantee a miss element outside the<para/>
''' image proper.<para/>
''' (5) The input pix, as extended by the extra pixels on selected sides,<para/>
''' can optionally be returned.  For debugging, call<para/>
''' pixDisplayHitMissSel() to visualize the hit-miss sel superimposed<para/>
''' on the generating bitmap.<para/>
