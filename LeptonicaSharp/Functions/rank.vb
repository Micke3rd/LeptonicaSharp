'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This defines, for each pixel in pixs, a neighborhood of
''' pixels given by a rectangle "centered" on the pixel.
''' This set of wfhf pixels has a distribution of values,
''' and if they are sorted in increasing order, we choose
''' the pixel such that rank(wfhf-1) pixels have a lower
''' or equal value and (1-rank)(wfhf-1) pixels have an equal
''' or greater value.
''' (2) By this definition, the rank = 0.0 pixel has the lowest
''' value, and the rank = 1.0 pixel has the highest value.
''' (3) We add mirrored boundary pixels to avoid boundary effects,
''' and put the filter center at (0, 0).
''' (4) This dispatches to grayscale erosion or dilation if the
''' filter dimensions are odd and the rank is 0.0 or 1.0, rsp.
''' (5) Returns a copy if both wf and hf are 1.
''' (6) Uses row-major or column-major incremental updates to the
''' histograms depending on whether hf GT wf or hv LT= wf, rsp.

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This is a convenience function that downscales, does
''' the rank filtering, and upscales.  Because the down-
''' and up-scaling functions are very fast compared to
''' rank filtering, the time it takes is reduced from that
''' for the simple rank filtering operation by approximately
''' the square of the scaling factor.
