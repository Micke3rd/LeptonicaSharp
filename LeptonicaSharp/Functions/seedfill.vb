'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This is for binary seedfill (aka "binary reconstruction").
''' (2) There are 3 cases
''' (a) pixd == null (make a new pixd)
''' (b) pixd == pixs (in-place)
''' (c) pixd != pixs
''' (3) If you know the case, use these patterns for clarity
''' (a) pixd = pixSeedfillBinary(NULL, pixs, ...);
''' (b) pixSeedfillBinary(pixs, pixs, ...);
''' (c) pixSeedfillBinary(pixd, pixs, ...);
''' (4) The resulting pixd contains the filled seed.  For some
''' applications you want to OR it with the inverse of
''' the filling mask.
''' (5) The input seed and mask images can be different sizes, but
''' in typical use the difference, if any, would be only
''' a few pixels in each direction.  If the sizes differ,
''' the clipping is handled by the low-level function
''' seedfillBinaryLow().

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) See usage for pixSeedfillBinary(), which has unrestricted fill.
''' In pixSeedfillBinary(), the filling distance is unrestricted
''' and can be larger than pixs, depending on the topology of
''' th mask.
''' (2) There are occasions where it is useful not to permit the
''' fill to go more than a certain distance into the mask.
''' %xmax specifies the maximum horizontal distance allowed
''' in the fill; %ymax does likewise in the vertical direction.
''' (3) Operationally, the max "distance" allowed for the fill
''' is a linear distance from the original seed, independent
''' of the actual mask topology.
''' (4) Another formulation of this problem, not implemented,
''' would use the manhattan distance from the seed, as
''' determined by a breadth-first search starting at the seed
''' boundaries and working outward where the mask fg allows.
''' How this might use the constraints of separate xmax and ymax
''' is not clear.

''' Notes
''' (1) This computes the distance of each pixel from the nearest

''' and the fg pixel distances increase linearly from 1 at the
''' boundary.  It can also be used to compute the distance of
''' each pixel from the nearest fg pixel, by inverting the input
''' image before calling this function.  Then all fg pixels have
''' a distance 0 and the bg pixel distances increase linearly
''' from 1 at the boundary.
''' (2) The algorithm, described in Leptonica on the page on seed
''' filling and connected components, is due to Luc Vincent.
''' In brief, we generate an 8 or 16 bpp image, initialized
''' with the fg pixels of the input pix set to 1 and the
''' 1-boundary pixels (i.e., the boundary pixels of width 1 on
''' the four sides set as either
''' L_BOUNDARY_BG 0
''' L_BOUNDARY_FG  max
''' where max = 0xff for 8 bpp and 0xffff for 16 bpp.
''' Then do raster/anti-raster sweeps over all pixels interior
''' to the 1-boundary, where the value of each new pixel is
''' taken to be 1 more than the minimum of the previously-seen
''' connected pixels (using either 4 or 8 connectivity).
''' Finally, set the 1-boundary pixels using the mirrored method;
''' this removes the max values there.
''' (3) Using L_BOUNDARY_BG clamps the distance to 0 at the
''' boundary.  Using L_BOUNDARY_FG allows the distance
''' at the image boundary to "float".
''' (4) For 4-connected, one could initialize only the left and top
''' 1-boundary pixels, and go all the way to the right
''' and bottom; then coming back reset left and top.  But we
''' instead use a method that works for both 4- and 8-connected.

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) The raster/anti-raster method for implementing this filling
''' operation was suggested by Ray Smith.
''' (2) This takes an arbitrary set of nonzero pixels in pixs, which
''' can be sparse, and spreads (extrapolates) the values to
''' fill all the pixels in pixd with the nonzero value it is
''' closest to in pixs.  This is similar (though not completely
''' equivalent) to doing a Voronoi tiling of the image, with a
''' tile surrounding each pixel that has a nonzero value.
''' All pixels within a tile are then closer to its "central"
''' pixel than to any others.  Then assign the value of the
''' "central" pixel to each pixel in the tile.
''' (3) This is implemented by computing a distance function in parallel
''' with the fill.  The distance function uses free boundary
''' conditions (assumed maxval outside), and it controls the
''' propagation of the pixels in pixd away from the nonzero
''' (seed) values.  This is done in 2 traversals (raster/antiraster).
''' In the raster direction, whenever the distance function
''' is nonzero, the spread pixel takes on the value of its
''' predecessor that has the minimum distance value.  In the
''' antiraster direction, whenever the distance function is nonzero
''' and its value is replaced by a smaller value, the spread
''' pixel takes the value of the predecessor with the minimum
''' distance value.
''' (4) At boundaries where a pixel is equidistant from two
''' nearest nonzero (seed) pixels, the decision of which value
''' to use is arbitrary (greedy in search for minimum distance).
''' This can give rise to strange-looking results, particularly
''' for 4-connectivity where the L1 distance is computed from
''' steps in N,S,E and W directions (no diagonals).

''' Notes
''' (1) This gives the actual local minima and maxima.
''' A local minimum is a pixel whose surrounding pixels all
''' have values at least as large, and likewise for a local
''' maximum.  For the local minima, %maxmin is the upper
''' bound for the value of pixs.  Likewise, for the local maxima,
''' %minmax is the lower bound for the value of pixs.
''' (2) The minima are found by starting with the erosion-and-equality
''' approach of pixSelectedLocalExtrema().  This is followed
''' by a qualification step, where each c.c. in the resulting
''' minimum mask is extracted, the pixels bordering it are
''' located, and they are queried.  If all of those pixels
''' are larger than the value of that minimum, it is a true
''' minimum and its c.c. is saved; otherwise the c.c. is
''' rejected.  Note that if a bordering pixel has the
''' same value as the minimum, it must then have a
''' neighbor that is smaller, so the component is not a
''' true minimum.
''' (3) The maxima are found by inverting the image and looking
''' for the minima there.
''' (4) The generated masks can be used as markers for
''' further operations.
