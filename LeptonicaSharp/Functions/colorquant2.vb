'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) %maxcolors must be in the range [2 ... 256].
''' (2) Use %outdepth = 0 to have the output depth computed as the
''' minimum required to hold the actual colors found, given
''' the %maxcolors constraint.
''' (3) Use %outdepth = 1, 2, 4 or 8 to specify the output depth.
''' In that case, %maxcolors must not exceed 2^(outdepth).
''' (4) If there are fewer quantized colors in the image than %maxcolors,
''' the colormap is simply generated from those colors.
''' (5) %maxsub is the maximum allowed subsampling to be used in the
''' computation of the color histogram and region of occupied
''' color space.  The subsampling is chosen internally for
''' efficiency, based on the image size, but this parameter
''' limits it.  Use %maxsub = 0 for the internal default, which is the
''' maximum allowed subsampling.  Use %maxsub = 1 to prevent
''' subsampling.  In general use %maxsub GT= 1 to specify the
''' maximum subsampling to be allowed, where the actual subsampling
''' will be the minimum of this value and the internally
''' determined default value.
''' (6) If the image appears gray because either most of the pixels
''' are gray or most of the pixels are essentially black or white,
''' the image is trivially quantized with a grayscale colormap.  The
''' reason is that median cut divides the color space into rectangular
''' regions, and it does a very poor job if all the pixels are
''' near the diagonal of the color space cube.

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) ncolor + ngray must not exceed 255.
''' (2) The method makes use of pixMedianCutQuantGeneral() with
''' minimal addition.
''' (a) Preprocess the image, setting all pixels with little color
''' to black, and populating an auxiliary 8 bpp image with the
''' expected colormap values corresponding to the set of
''' quantized gray values.
''' (b) Color quantize the altered input image to n + 1 colors.
''' (c) Augment the colormap with the gray indices, and
''' substitute the gray quantized values from the auxiliary
''' image for those in the color quantized output that had
''' been quantized as black.
''' (3) Median cut color quantization is relatively poor for grayscale
''' images with many colors, when compared to octcube quantization.
''' Thus, for images with both gray and color, it is important
''' to quantize the gray pixels by another method.  Here, we
''' are conservative in detecting color, preferring to use
''' a few extra bits to encode colorful pixels that push them
''' to gray.  This is particularly reasonable with this function,
''' because it handles the gray and color pixels separately,
''' using median cut color quantization for the color pixels
''' and equal-bin grayscale quantization for the non-color pixels.

'''  <summary>
''' Notes
''' (1) This is the "few colors" version of pixMedianCutQuantMixed().
''' It fails (returns NULL) if it finds more than maxncolors, but
''' otherwise it gives the same result.
''' (2) Recommended input parameters are
''' %maxncolors  20
''' %darkthresh  20
''' %lightthresh 244
''' %diffthresh  15  (any higher can miss colors differing
''' slightly from gray)
''' (3) Both ncolor and ngray should be at least equal to maxncolors.
''' If they're not, they are automatically increased, and a
''' warning is given.
''' (4) If very little color content is found, the input is
''' converted to gray and quantized in equal intervals.
''' (5) This can be useful for quantizing orthographically generated
''' images such as color maps, where there may be more than 256 colors
''' because of aliasing or jpeg artifacts on text or lines, but
''' there are a relatively small number of solid colors.
''' (6) Example of usage
''' // Try to quantize, using default values for mixed med cut
''' Pix pixq = pixFewColorsMedianCutQuantMixed(pixs, 100, 20,
''' 0, 0, 0, 0);
''' if (!pixq)  // too many colors; don't quantize
