''' Notes
''' (1) Ankur Jain suggested and implemented extending the composite
''' DWA operations beyond the 63 pixel limit.  This is a
''' simplified and approximate implementation of the extension.
''' This allows arbitrary Dwa morph operations using brick Sels,
''' by decomposing the horizontal and vertical dilations into
''' a sequence of 63-element dilations plus a dilation of size
''' between 3 and 62.
''' (2) The 63-element dilations are exact, whereas the extra dilation
''' is approximate, because the underlying decomposition is
''' in pixDilateCompBrickDwa().  See there for further details.
''' (3) There are three cases
''' (a) pixd == null   (result into new pixd)
''' (b) pixd == pixs   (in-place; writes result back to pixs)
''' (c) pixd != pixs   (puts result into existing pixd)

''' Notes
''' (1) The DWA implementation allows Sels to be used with hits
''' up to 31 pixels from the origin, either horizontally or
''' vertically.  Larger Sels can be used if decomposed into
''' a set of operations with Sels not exceeding 63 pixels
''' in either width or height (and with the origin as close
''' to the center of the Sel as possible).
''' (2) This returns the decomposition of a linear Sel of length
''' %size into a set of %n Sels of length 63 plus an extra
''' Sel of length %extra.
''' (3) For notation, let w == %size, n == %n, and e == %extra.
''' We have 1 LT e LT 63.
''' Then if w LT 64, we have n = 0 and e = w.
''' The general formula for w GT 63 is
''' w = 63 + (n - 1)  62 + (e - 1)
''' Where did this come from?  Each successive convolution with
''' a Sel of length L adds a total length (L - 1) to w.
''' This accounts for using 62 for each additional Sel of size 63,
''' and using (e - 1) for the additional Sel of size e.
''' Solving for n and e for w GT 63
''' n = 1 + Int((w - 63) / 62)
''' e = w - 63 - (n - 1)  62 + 1
''' The extra part is decomposed into two factors f1 and f2,
''' and the actual size of the extra part is
''' e' = f1  f2
''' Then the actual width is
''' w' = 63 + (n - 1)  62 + f1  f2 - 1
